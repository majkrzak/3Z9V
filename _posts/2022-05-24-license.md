# Time of patience ended.

I finally received the email I was long waiting for. Naturally it landed in the folder where it belongs â€“ the spam folder. Offices and electronic correspondence never came along, even the office of electronic communication. But this is topic for longer story.

It took almost a month, since I passed the exam at 28th of April till today, when I received my licence. Some may say that it is not that long, but at the other hand there is no much work to be done to issue the licence.


# But not entairly.

Even tho I'm finally the licensed operator, I still don't have the equipment. The HF QRP transceiver is on its way, which can not be named the shortest one. I will be in my hands tomorrow.
